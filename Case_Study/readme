## 🧠 Project 1: Green AI – Sustainable Machine Learning

### 📝 Description

Green AI focuses on creating environmentally sustainable AI solutions by reducing energy usage and computational cost. In this part of the project, we developed a lightweight, optimized model using Python, aiming to minimize resource consumption while maintaining performance.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts
- Model pruning & quantization
- Transfer learning to reduce training time
- Tracking carbon emissions with [CodeCarbon](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/)
- Performance vs. energy trade-off analysis

#### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn / PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- CodeCarbon
